# Academic Risk Prediction & Role-Based Analytics System

This project is an end-to-end **Academic Risk Prediction System** that uses **Machine Learning (XGBoost)** and **Power BI dashboards** to identify academically at-risk students early and support data-driven academic interventions.

The system generates predictions in Python and surfaces insights through three role-based dashboards:

- 🎓 **Admin Dashboard**
- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher Dashboard**
- 🧑‍🎓 **Student Dashboard**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional academic monitoring systems often flag students only after they fail or show severe decline in performance.  
The goal of this project is to **predict at-risk students early** by combining multiple dimensions such as:

- Academic performance  
- Attendance & engagement  
- Financial background  
- Mental health & stress indicators  
- Co-curricular participation

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Created a realistic synthetic student dataset using **Python** with:
     - `Faker` for realistic demographic and textual fields
     - `NumPy` & `Pandas` for numeric and categorical features
   - Features included: grades, attendance, backlogs, fees, scholarships, stress level, activities, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Engineered features such as:
     - Attendance percentage
     - Backlog count
     - Engagement score (activities, clubs, events)
     - Risk factors based on academics + behaviour

3. **Modeling – XGBoost**
   - Trained an **XGBoost classification model** to predict whether a student is **At Risk** or **Safe**.
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to improve generalization.

4. **Power BI Dashboards**
   - Exported model outputs and enriched student data to **Power BI**.
   - Designed three role-based dashboards:
     - **Admin:** holistic view of total students, fees, scholarships, backlog %, attendance trends, at-risk distribution by course & year.
     - **Teacher:** student performance, marks vs attendance, stress levels, assignment submissions, disciplinary cases, and at-risk status.
     - **Student:** personal analytics such as attendance, marks, mental health score, activities, and feedback to encourage self-awareness.

## 📊 Key Features

- Early prediction of **at-risk students** using ML.
- Role-based dashboards for:
  - **Admin:** policy & resource planning
  - **Teacher:** class-level and student-level intervention
  - **Student:** self-monitoring and engagement
- Visual insights into:
  - Attendance & marks trends
  - Gender & category distribution
  - Income & scholarship distribution
  - Engagement and mental health indicators
